# GridSim

The [GridSim](@ref) package is a simple package to simulate a random grid-based game.

It is a very flexible package, you just have to pass it an initial grid and a rule (via [newgame](lib/public.md#GridSim.newgame)), then you can iterate over the simulation (via [days](lib/public.md#GridSim.days)) and do whatever you want with this iteration.

See [starting](starting.md) for more information on how to start using the package, and [example](example.md) for a complete example.
